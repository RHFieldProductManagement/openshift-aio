# **Deploy Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)**

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) offers end-to-end visibility and control for managing your cluster and application lifecycle. Among other features, it ensures security and compliance for the entire Kubernetes domain across multiple data centers and public clouds. 

This lab will focus on installing and configuring Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) to enable the AIO OpenShift deployed cluster to provide observability, governement and application management. The mechanism for installation is to utilise the operator model via the cli, just like we did in many of our previous labs. Note, it's entirely possible to deploy via the web UI should you wish to do so, but we're not documenting that mechanism here.
